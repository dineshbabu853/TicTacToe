# TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game with varying difficulty modes.  
In normal mode the opponent's(computer) move will be on the first non-filled box!  
Whereas in difficult mode the opponent's move will be on the best spot which is provided by the minimax Algorithm to find best spot and thus becomes un-beatable.
